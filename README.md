## Motivation
Automatically describing images using natural sentences is an essential task to visually impaired people's inclusion on the Internet.
Although there are many datasets in the literature, most of them contain only English captions, whereas datasets with captions described in other languages are scarce. Then, inspired by the [PraCegoVer](https://mwpt.com.br/criadora-do-projeto-pracegover-incentiva-descricao-de-imagens-na-web/) moviment, we introduce the \#PraCegoVer dataset.

\#PraCegoVer has more than 500 thousand pairs with images and captions described in Portuguese collected from more than 14 thousand different profiles. Also, 
the mean caption length in \#PraCegoVer is 39.3 words and standard deviation is 29.7, whereas the captions in [MS COCO Captions](http://cocodataset.org/) 10.5	words on average and standard deviation of 2.2. These chacteristics make our dataset more challenging than MS COCO.
